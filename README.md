# fake-flight-oracle-api

It's just a simple api that provides fake flights information for a dapp. **This api was developed as part of my TCC project**.

## Important note
It's not a good practice to upload node_modules, but I needed to upload because the api is deployed on aws using code pipeline and elastic beanstalk.
## How to run
- `npm start`

## Technologies
- nodeJS
- prisma
